# Minesweeper-Clone
Like many before me, I've made another version of minesweeper. I made this project years ago, but recently I decided to try and get a web demo of it.
You can play it at https://nullpointer1331.github.io/Minesweeper-Clone/
You could also download Minesweeper Build.zip if you want to run it on your computer. 

Most of the files here, other than Minesweeper Build.zip and everything in the WebGL Build folder, are source code and assets.
