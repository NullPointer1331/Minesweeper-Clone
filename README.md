# Minesweeper-Clone
Like many before me, I've made another version of minesweeper. I made this project years ago, but recently I decided to try and get a web demo of it. It's not the prettiest, but it works
You can play it at https://nullpointer1331.github.io/Minesweeper-Clone/
You could also download Minesweeper Build.zip if you want to run it on your computer. 

Most of the files here, other than Minesweeper Build.zip and everything in the WebGL Build folder, are source code and assets.

If you don't already know the rules of minesweeper, the goal is to reveal the board and mark the mines without setting any off. 
Left click to reveal a tile, if it's a mine, you lose, and if it's not a mine the number shows how many mines are adjacent to it.
Right click to mark a tile as a mine, or unmark a tile.
Middle click to quickly reveal all normal tiles around a tile. It only works if that tile has enough mines marked around it.
